TODO
Add COMMENT to upload at http://localhost:8000/myapp/list/.
Re-access the patient and add/change/delete items on the patient and upload files list.
    This is working fine in administration, but; I want it in a form.
Add file uploads to patient.

Created.



./manage.py migrate myapp
gets
django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: django_content_type
./manage.py migrate
fixes it.


Add patient to model, like proActive patientEval.

Add admin; it wouldn't show Documents or Patient evals. I left, ran some errands and
when I came back it works fine. That means it wasn't updated. If it makes sense that it
should be working, restart and give it another try?
