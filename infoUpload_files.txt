When I start the DEV server with runserver I always get Page not found (404) for http://localhost:8000/myapp/list/
    though http://localhost:8000/myapp/list/ is not in the code anywhere that I can find.

    tried
    ./manage.py runserver -v3 0.0.0.0:8000
    and I don't get anything more verbose
    Somewhere it stopped working for
    http://localhost:8000/myapp/documents/
    http://localhost:8000/myapp/patientEvals/
    with the same error.
    Sometimes it works, and other times not.
    In Google Chrome http://localhost:8000 gets redirected to http://localhost:8000/myapp/list/
    Switching to Firefox http://localhost:8000 goes, as it should, to http://localhost:8000/myapp/documents/



Add COMMENT to upload at http://localhost:8000/myapp/list/.
Re-access the patient and add/change/delete items on the patient and upload files list.
    This is working fine in administration, but; I want it in a form.
Add file uploads to patient.

Created.



./manage.py migrate myapp
gets
django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: django_content_type
./manage.py migrate
fixes it.


Add patient to model, like proActive patientEval.

Add admin; it wouldn't show Documents or Patient evals. I left, ran some errands and
when I came back it works fine. That means it wasn't updated. If it makes sense that it
should be working, restart and give it another try?
